# Bike-sharing-prediction
Bike-sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, the user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back to another position.
We can use this predictive model for any season and environmental parameters (which we know in advance) and can predict the count of the bikes to be rented. The ability to predict the number of hourly users can allow the entities (businesses/governments) that oversee these systems to manage them in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.
